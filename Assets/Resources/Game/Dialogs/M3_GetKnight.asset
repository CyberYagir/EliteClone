    text: Alive, looks like your plan worked. It really shook me. But it pleases
      that now there is no dependence on them, but they are also not idiots and probably
      already know that the transmitter is not working. And I know that he is at

    text: The communists in your sector are the biggest suppliers of zinc. They have
      an approach for cargo ships in the station. You can try to make money on simple
      orders, and buy a Knight ship. It is very cheap and popular.

    text: 'The average price of an empty ship without modules is about 6k credits,
      with modules you can buy somewhere for 10k for sure.

      The price is different
      at each shipyard, and depends on the shortage of modules and demand. End of
