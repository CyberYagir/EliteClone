      me that could kill me, I don\u2019t know if this is a bluff or not, but if
      this chip really exists, is it possible to deactivate it somehow? Over."

    text: I told you it wouldn't be that easy for you. There is one idea, every Pirate
      in any system has a circuit on the ship that transmits data in a special way,
      they do not use the "Tachyon Communication" as it is easy to intercept, they
      use data transmission to a large server in the void between two galaxies.
    finishMethodName: 
  - character: 2
    text: Communication is rare, but instantaneous through the fourth dimension.
      During data transfer, they create a strong electromagnetic pulse that can disrupt
      your chip if manually activated.

    text: 'First you need to visit the space station, and equip the lasers there,
      which, according to your ship, are disabled here for greater autonomy, they
      must be reflashed and assigned to the control panel.

      End of connection.'
