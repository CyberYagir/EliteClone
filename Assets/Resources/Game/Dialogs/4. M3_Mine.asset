    text: You will never run out of loans. Blow your goddamn head off, I don't even
      know what you did to get that much money. But let's skip the details, you need
      to have at least a few storages with resources in the hold of the ship, they
      need to be obtained with a mining laser or in another way. Specifically, you
      need to get Zinc, but you will need to search the galaxy for an asteroid belt
      with it. End of connection.
