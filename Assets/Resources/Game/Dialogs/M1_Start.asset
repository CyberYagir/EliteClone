    text: The owner of the costume turns out to be a man who worked as a "Repairman"
      on one of the Dyson spheres 50 apiaries from you. And it obviously can't be
      him since he already died in an accident that happened 50 years ago. He forgot
      to wear insurance and died in the void. His body was found only a few days
      later. The party didn't even give him a lifeline, but he worked to the best
      of his ability to give to each according to need. It seems to me that the motto
      of the communists should be "There will be as little need as possible from
      everyone." Over.
